   You have high blood pressure. Take your medicine daily.
   ```
3. Select language: **Kannada** (or Hindi/Telugu)
4. Click "Translate"
5. **See**: Translated text (or original as fallback)

**What Happens**:
- ✅ Text is processed
- ✅ Shows translated version
- ✅ Or gracefully falls back to original (without API key)

---

### TEST 3: Case Summarization

**Steps**:
1. Find "Patient Case" or "Case Summary" section
2. Fill in patient information:

(Uses medical terminology)
```

**Patient Version** (Simple):
```
John Doe, you are being treated for high blood sugar disease...
(Uses simple language)
```

**What Happens**:
- ✅ Case data is analyzed
- ✅ Two summaries are generated
- ✅ Medical terms auto-simplified in patient version
- ✅ Clear differentiation between versions

---

### TEST 4: Medical Text Detection

**Steps**:

## 📊 COMPLETE DEMO FLOW

**Scenario**: You are demonstrating the MedGPT Pro system to a healthcare team

### Phase 1: Introduction (30 seconds)
```
"This is MedGPT Pro - an intelligent medical text processing system.
It helps doctors communicate complex medical information in simple, 
patient-friendly language."
```

### Phase 2: Simplification Demo (1-2 minutes)

**Show**:
1. Type: "The patient has acute myocardial infarction"
2. Click Simplify
3. **Result**: "The patient has sudden and severe heart attack"

**Say**:
```
"Watch how complex medical terminology is instantly converted 
to language your patients can understand. Medical jargon is 
automatically simplified."
```

### Phase 3: Translation Demo (1-2 minutes)

**Show**:
1. Enter: "Take your medicine every morning with food"
2. Select: Kannada
3. Click Translate
4. **Result**: Translated text appears

**Say**:
```
"The system supports multiple regional languages. 
Healthcare providers can communicate with patients in their 
preferred language - English, Kannada, Hindi, or Telugu."
```

### Phase 4: Case Summarization Demo (2-3 minutes)

**Show**:
1. Fill in a patient case:
   - Name: Ramesh Kumar
   - Age: 58
   - Diagnosis: Type 2 Diabetes with Hypertension
   - Symptoms: Excessive thirst, fatigue
   - Treatment: Medication daily
   - Prognosis: Manageable with compliance

2. Click "Generate Summary"

   **Doctor's Version**:
   ```
   "58-year-old patient presenting with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
   and Hypertension. Chief complaints include polyuria and fatigue..."
   ```

   **Patient's Version**:
   ```
   "You are being treated for high blood sugar disease and high blood 
   pressure. Your symptoms include excessive thirst and tiredness..."
   ```

**Say**:
```
"The same patient case is presented in two different ways:
- For doctors: Technical, clinical language with medical terms
- For patients: Simple, easy-to-understand language

This ensures proper communication between healthcare providers 
and patients at their literacy level."
```

### Phase 5: Detection Demo (30 seconds)

**Show**:
1. Type: "Myocardial infarction"
2. **Show**: "isMedical: true"
3. Type: "It's a nice day"
4. **Show**: "isMedical: false"

**Say**:
```
